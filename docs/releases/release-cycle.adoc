== Scope of the document

This document outlines our release cycle.

== Release process

=== The release cycle explained

* Releases are drafted by maintainers. The projects that use SemVer to determine versioning, are released on a bi-weekly cycle. To see when the next cycle starts, take a look at the

* We aim to push releases during the first half of the week, for example on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.
* If there is no release by Friday of the first week, the ongoing release cycle has been skipped.
** Additional information about skipped cycles _can_ be obtained from the release calendar alongside confirmed releases.
* Releases are not pushed on weekends.
* Releases may not be exclusive to the bi-weekly cycle, but releases outside the release cycle do not modify it.
*** Example: A release on a Wednesday followed by an important regression fix on next weeks Monday does not postpone the release from the following week.
* Exemptions of the cycle are possible:
** Security fixes can be released at any time outside the cycle.
** Releases are skipped if no notable changes for the end user would be included in a release.
*** Example: Dependency updates, code refactoring, etc.
