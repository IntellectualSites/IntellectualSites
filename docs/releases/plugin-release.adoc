= Howto: Release

toc::[]

== Scope of the document

This document helps developers and maintainers to draft releases.

== Update the codebase

* If you can't push to the default branch, push the work to another branch a maintainer will then merge (not squash!). Every number is a commit.

** 1. Replace all `@since TODO` and `@deprecated(since = "TODO")` in the code with the version you look forward to release.
** 2. Remove `-SNAPSHOT` in `build.gradle.kts` or adjust the version format, depending on the project.
** 3. Increase the version, for example, if we release 1.0.0, increase it to 1.0.1-SNAPSHOT.

* Create a pull request, if all checks passed, GitHub allows you to merge the branch. If there are errors, ping `@IntellectualSites/core-team`.

== Publish the changelog

If you click on the "Releases" tab on GitHub, you see a draft. Edit the draft and make sure the tag fits the version you want to release. +
You can copy the release tab changelogs and use them on Discord or other platforms, where we announce our changes.

== Publish the API

If a project has an API, it's deployed to the central repository automatically within the release pull request. If there is an issue with that, the GitHub action lets you know.

== Publish the end user artifact

Upload the release artifact (not the artifact with the already increased build number!) to either Spigot or dev.bukkit.org and paste the previously assembled changelog in the changelog field.

[NOTE]
dev.bukkit.org moderates submitted files by "first in first out". The moderation times are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM GMT.

If you need help, don't hesitate to ask maintainers who did releases in the past.
