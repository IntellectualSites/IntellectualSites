== Scope of the document

This document outlines all services or accounts connected and operated by IntellectualSites, ordered alphabetically.
Keyholder services' only purpose is to claim our name. These services are not actively used by us. +
Any service or account not listed is not affected, owned or controlled by IntellectualSites in any form, unless inherited. +
For example, if `abc.com/users/intellectualsites` would inherit a resource published at `abc.com` that identifiable forwards to the domain listed, it's clear that this resource is owned by IntellectualSites.
