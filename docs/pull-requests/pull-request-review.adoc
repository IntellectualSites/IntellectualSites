== Scope of the document

* This document outlines how we review pull requests.

== Merge process

=== Common merge process

==== Step 1: Maintainer checklist

A merge process can be initiated once a pull request matches the requirements:

* The pull request is compliant with the requirements to submitters (see our link:https://github.com/IntellectualSites/.github/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md[pull request template])
* There are at least 2 project developer approvals for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change.
** Pull requests that target documentation changes or minor changes, such as typo fixes, may only require the approval from one maintainer or project developer.
* Conversations in the pull request are over, or it is explicit that a reviewer does not block the change (often indicated by clicking the `Resolve Conversation` button on line comments)
* Changelog entries in the PR title are correct and reflect the current, final state of the PR.
* The proper labels for the PR are assigned. For example `Bugfix` or `Feature` for automatic changelog generation.
* If the change needs end users to be aware of it when upgrading, for example when modifying permissions or long term behavior, outline it within a comment on the PR.

==== Step 2: Is it a good time to merge?

* If a PR has passed the review process, but may be blocked by other PRs, for example at other projects, make sure to add a comment explaining why it was put on hold.
* Very large changes or major refactors may not be merged before smaller PRs to keep the rebase noise as small as possible.

==== Step 3: Marking for merge

Once the checklist is passed, a maintainer can mark the pull request for merge.

* An explicit comment is added to the pull request so that other repository watchers are notified and the label `Ready for merge` is applied.
A grace period of 24 hours allows previous reviewers to leave final concerns to prevent regressions.

==== Step 4: Merge!

A maintainer or project developer merges the PR.

=== Exceptions

* Security fixes use a different process.
They are reviewed and integrated by maintainers at any time.
* 24 hours waiting period is not required for:
** changes that do not result in changes to the primary functionality, such as typo fixes in documentation or translation files.
** changes that do not affect the production code: GitHub workflow tweaks, bot configurations, etc.
** Broken main branch builds.

=== Should I squash a PR or not?

We squash all pull requests, unless a PR is explicitly marked as not to be squashed.
